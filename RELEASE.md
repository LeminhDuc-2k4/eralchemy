```md
**Double check for quality-control**

- [ ] There are no [open issues with a `impact: block-release` label](https://github.com/eralchemy/eralchemy/labels/block-release)

**Prepare the codebase for a new version**

- [ ] Bump `__version__` in [`pyproject.toml`](https://github.com/eralchemy/eralchemy/blob/main/pyproject.toml#L8)
- [ ] Make a release commit: `git commit -m 'bump: 0.1.9 â†’ 0.2.0'`
- [ ] Push the RLS commit `git push upstream main`
- [ ] If a **release candidate** is needed, tick this box when we're now ready for a full release.

**Make the release**

- [ ] [Start a new GitHub release](https://github.com/eralchemy/eralchemy/releases/new)
  - Call the release the current version, e.g. `v0.2.0`
  - In the **`Choose a Tag:`** dropdown, type in the release name (e.g., `v0.2.0`) and click "Create new tag"
  - In the **`Target:`** dropdown, pin it to the release commit that you've just pushed.
  - Generate the automatic release notes, eventually manually specify the previous version (useful when several release candidate have been made)
- [ ] Confirm that the release completed
  - [The `publish` github action job](https://github.com/eralchemy/eralchemy/blob/main/.github/workflows/publish.yaml) has completed successfully in the [actions tab](https://github.com/eralchemy/eralchemy/actions).
  - [The PyPI version is updated](https://pypi.org/project/eralchemy/)
- [ ] Hide the previous patch version build in the RDT interface if needed.
- [ ] Celebrate, you're done!
